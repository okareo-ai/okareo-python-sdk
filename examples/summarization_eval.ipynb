Merson initially angered Townsend for writing in his Sky Sports column that 'if Andros Townsend can get in ( the England team ) then it opens it up to anybody .

'It 's not as though I was watching hoping he would n't score for England , I 'm genuinely pleased for him and fair play to him â€“ it was a great goal , ' Merson said . 'It 's just a matter of opinion , and my opinion was that he got pulled off after half an hour at Manchester United in front of Roy Hodgson , so he should n't have been in the squad . 'When I 'm wrong , I hold my hands up . I do n't have a problem with doing that - I 'll always be the first to admit when I 'm wrong .
