    "\n",
    "Think of the Driver as an improv actor whose *script* is your prompt.  Okareo feeds this script into an LLM and asks it to stay in‑character for multiple turns while pursuing the objectives you set.  The better the script, the more faithfully the Driver will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Speak with the intended persona (e.g. a confused policy‑holder, a sarcastic teenager, a polite business user).\n",
    "* Follow a realistic progression of questions or requests.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why is a well‑structured template necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are extremely capable but also *stochastic*—without clear guard‑rails they tend to drift, forget goals, or contradict previous statements.  A rigorously structured prompt gives them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context** – who they are and what they know.\n",
    "2. **Goals** – what outcome they’re trying to achieve this session.\n",
    "3. **Constraints** – red lines they should never cross (e.g. no profanity, do not reveal internal IDs).\n",
    "4. **Self‑monitoring hooks** – short checklists that force the model to verify it is still on target each turn.\n",

    "(e.g., \"Alright, I will initiate the exchange of {scenario_input.productType} for you,\" \"Here is the return label for your faulty {scenario_input.productType}\"\".  \n",

    "\n",

    "    - \"*sigh* This has been an incredibly frustrating process\"\n",

    "    - A return label and the promise of a replacement\n",
    "    - A full refund for your faulty product\n",
