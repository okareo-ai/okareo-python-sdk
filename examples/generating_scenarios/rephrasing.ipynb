    "This is a demo of the Okareo rephrasing generator. The rephrasing generator is useful when you would like to automatically create test cases with semantically identical content but different wording. This generator can be used to ensure that slightly different inputs to your LLM/RAG system do not substantially change the results.\n",

    "\n",
